## Description
Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that generates a webpage displaying a team's basic information.

## User Story
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information, so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input:

- **Entering Team Members' Information:** When I am prompted for my team members and their information, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
- **Interacting with Email Addresses:** When I click on an email address in the HTML, my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
- **Interacting with GitHub Usernames:** When I click on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
- **Starting the Application:** When I start the application, I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
- **Entering the Team Manager's Information:** When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern, or to finish building my team.
- **Adding an Engineer:** When I select the engineer option, I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
- **Adding an Intern:** When I select the intern option, I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
- **Completing Team Building:** When I decide to finish building my team, I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
